# WABH_Analysis
This project considers the use of p-value weighting to voxel-based lesion behavior mapping (VLSM) studies. Our methods are 
demonstrated on an aphasia study investigating which regions of the brain are associated with the severity of language impairment 
among stroke survivors. The data for this study is not publically available but can be obtained by contacting the study PI's 
Julius Fridriksson (jfridrik 'at' sc 'dot' edu) or Christopher Rorden (RORDEN "at" mailbox 'dot' sc 'dot' edu). 

For this analysis, we use the results of voxel-by-voxel logistic regression analysis of lesion status (yes/no) by Aphasia
Quotient (AQ) (logit transformed), total lesion volume and months since stroke at the time of the examination.  This data 
is available at https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/RQZZP1 and once it is saved all results of the paper can be reproduced.
